# Hi there, I'm Luiz Felipe! 👋

**Senior Mobile Software Engineer | Flutter, Android & iOS**

I am a Mobile Engineer with 4+ years of experience building scalable applications and **bridging the gap between Flutter and Native platforms**. I specialize in extending hybrid frameworks with custom native code, ensuring high performance and deep integration on both **Android** and **iOS**.

Whether it's writing a custom **Kotlin** plugin for a POS machine or managing memory with **Swift** for a media player, I focus on delivering robust mobile engineering solutions.

### 🚀 Technical Focus

* **Native Interoperability:** Expert in Platform Channels (Method Channels) to expose native APIs (Bluetooth, Hardware, SDKs) to Flutter environments.
* **Android Engineering:** Experience with Kotlin/Java, Services, Broadcast Receivers, and specific hardware integrations (SmartPOS, Thermal Printers).
* **iOS Engineering:** Proficient in Swift/Objective-C, App Lifecycle, and dependency management (CocoaPods).
* **DevOps & Automation:** Automating build and release pipelines for **Google Play** and **App Store** using Fastlane and CI/CD tools.

### 📦 Featured Open Source
