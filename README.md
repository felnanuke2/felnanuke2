# Luiz Felipe Lima

**Flutter Developer | Backend Enthusiast | Open Source Contributor**

I specialize in building high-quality mobile experiences using **Flutter** and **Dart**. I have a strong interest in software architecture, specifically Clean Architecture and scalable whitelabel systems. I also have experience building the backend services that power these apps using NestJS and .NET.

### 💻 Current Focus

  * **Cross-Platform Development:** Building apps that feel native on both iOS and Android.
  * **Native Integration:** Using Pigeon and Method Channels to access device-specific features.
  * **DevOps:** Automating the boring stuff with Fastlane and CI/CD pipelines.

### 📦 Featured Open Source

> **[Flutter Chrome Cast](https://github.com/felnanuke2/flutter_google_cast)**
>
> I maintain a plugin that enables Google Cast integration for Flutter applications. It utilizes native platform channels to allow users to cast content directly from their mobile devices.
